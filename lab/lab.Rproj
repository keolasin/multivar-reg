# Lab 1 Notes

## Exporting & Importing Data

Absolute vs relative/local paths

- using the relative path is typically better (Example: "data.csv")
- when the project is setup, make sure the data you want to work with lives in the working directory to avoid having to use the entirety of the file path
- also possible to use the absolute path (Example: "C://users/data/set1/data.csv")

To check the working directory, can use `getwd()` function.

## Resources & Packages

The following are packages used in this document for analysis. 

```{r packages}

  "readr",
  "dplyr",
  "knitr",
  "ggplot2"
)

install.packages(packages)
```

```{r libraries}
libraries <- c(
  "tidyr",
  "readr",
  "dplyr",
  "knitr",
  "ggplot2"
)

lapply(libraries, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

```{r example}
