# Introductory Lab

```{r setup}



```

## Learning Objectives

Practice with R, applying material from lecture

## Homework Tips

- homework not hard, but pay attention to data cleaning/processing.
- remember to attach your code in submissions. Submit the pdf/html output.
- Always provide justifications on the statistical test/method you chose, even if you are not asked.

## Project Tips

- Start early to think about the problem to address and the data to analyze
- Do not take the R markdown output as your final report
- Your final report should tell a complete story. Provide detailed justifications on the method you chose.
- Interpret your results. Check model assumptions. Do model diagnostics.
